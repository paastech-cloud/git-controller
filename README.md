### Rust

### Git

- Try to stick as close as possible to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), here is a [list of verbs](https://gkarthiks.github.io/quick-commands-cheat-sheet/conventional-commit-verbs.html)
- Use the provided pull request templates for pull requests
- Use [labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-labels)
